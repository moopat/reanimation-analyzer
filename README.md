# reanimation-analyzer

Android framework reference implementation for the SWE02 lecture at FH JOANNEUM.

Reanimation Analyzer helps to analyze reanimation efficiency during training. Place the phone on the chest of the training manikin in the place that is supposed to be compressed, place your hands on the smartphone and start with chest compressions. The app will indicate if the compression frequency is within limits (100-120 is recommended at the moment). This is just a demo implementation, not suitable for use on real patients, and not actively maintained.
